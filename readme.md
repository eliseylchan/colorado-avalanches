This is my final project for Intro to Data Science at Middlebury College in Fall 2022. The assignment was to make four visualizations to explore a dataset of my choosing using R. I choose to look at avalanches during the 2021-2022 winter season in Colorado. I acquired data from Colorado Avalanche Information Centerâ€™s online Observation Explorer, which is free and open to the public.

## Data
-   **CAIC_obs.csv** - raw observation data downloaded from the [CAIC website](https://forecasts.avalanche.state.co.us/explorer/)
-   **avy_triggers.csv** - the codes CAIC uses for avalanche trigger types
-   **compass.csv** - lists cardinal directions and equivalent degrees, used in Figure 3
